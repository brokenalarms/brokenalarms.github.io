I am a Software Engineer (Frontend) for LinkedIn, living in San Francisco.

I've done quite a lot before I made it here: studied Law and Psychology in Australia and Sweden; played in new-folk and doom metal bands through Edinburgh, Manchester and London; worked for a public inquiry in Northern Ireland investigating a proposed government conspiracy; traveled through areas including Russia, Japan, and most of western and central-east Europe; and studied Computer Science (for the second time) in Canterbury, England.

I think a lot about self development and the best ways I can learn new things and continually improve myself. This blog is mainly for me to document my progress in these areas, keep myself accountable, and maybe teach someone else something.

So yes, just another self-indulgent productivity blog.
